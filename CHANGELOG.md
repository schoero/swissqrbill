## [v4.0.0](https://github.com/schoero/swissqrbill/compare/v3.2.2...v4.0.0) - 10.11.2023

With version 4, SwissQRBill has been completely reworked. The main goal was to make the API more flexible and reduce the complexity of the library. As a consequence, the API has changed quite significantly. However, migration should be fairly easy.  

Please read the [migration guide](docs/migration-v3-to-v4.md) for more information and have a look at the updated [documentation](docs).

- New features
  - SwissQRBill can now be attached to any PDFDocument instance from PDFKit.
  - New SwissQRCode class to create the standalone Swiss QR Code to attach to an existing PDFKit document.
  - New Table class to create a table to attach to an existing PDFKit document.
  - It is now possible to change the font of the QR Bill. The allowed fonts are `"Arial"` | `"Frutiger"` | `"Helvetica"` | `"Liberation Sans"`
  - Additional options for SVG renderings.

- Breaking changes
  - The entrypoints have changed. Please read the [importing documentation](docs/importing.md) for more information.
  - SwissQRBill no longer extends PDFKit.
  - The table method has been extracted into it's own class.
  - Events have been removed from SwissQRBill.
  - Properties and options have been renamed.
  - Now requires Node.js >= 18.0.0

- Fixes
  - Some slight rendering improvements.

- Other improvements
  - Better examples. The examples are now automatically hosted on StackBlitz. Everyone can now easily try out the library in the browser without having to install anything.
  - Automated documentation. SwissQRBill now uses [unwritten](https://github.com/schoero/unwritten) to automatically generate the documentation. This makes it easier to keep the documentation up to date.
  - Automated testing for even more stability.

Thanks to [@danielpanero](https://github.com/danielpanero) and [@skch-17](https://github.com/skch-17) for their contributions.
